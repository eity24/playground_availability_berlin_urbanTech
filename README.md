# playground_availability_berlin_urbanTech
GIS-based analysis of playground availability across Berlin districts using OpenStreetMap data and child population statistics to identify spatial inequality.

## Objective
To evaluate playground availability relative to child population (0–14 years)
using a population-adjusted indicator.

## Data Sources
- OpenStreetMap (playground locations)
- ODIS Berlin (district boundaries)
- Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg (child population)

## Method
- Spatial aggregation of playgrounds by district
- Join with child population data
- Calculation of playgrounds per 1,000 children
- Visualization using choropleth maps

## Tools
- QGIS
- OpenStreetMap
- Excel (charts)

## Output
- District-level table
- Choropleth map
- Bar chart
- Presentation slides

## Future Work
- Network-based accessibility analysis
- Python automation using GeoPandas
