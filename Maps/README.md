# Maps

This folder contains map outputs generated using QGIS for the project
**Playground Availability in Berlin**.

## Contents

- **Choropleth map of playground availability**  
  District-level visualization showing the number of playgrounds per 1,000 children (aged 0–14).
  Darker colors indicate higher availability, while lighter colors indicate lower access.

- **Playground point locations**  
  Individual playground locations extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data,
  overlaid on district boundaries.

## Purpose

These maps are used to visually identify spatial inequality in playground access
across Berlin districts and to support the results presented in the report and presentation.
